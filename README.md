# geneal_tsp_150subang
This project applies a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a 150-city map of Subang Jaya. The aim is to find near-optimal routes, addressing real-world constraints like road restrictions, while balancing computational efficiency and practicality in logistics optimization.
